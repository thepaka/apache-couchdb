Description: RESTful document oriented database
 Apache CouchDB is a distributed, fault-tolerant and schema-free
 document-oriented database accessible via a RESTful HTTP/JSON API. Among other
 features, it provides robust, incremental replication with bi-directional
 conflict detection and resolution, and is queryable and indexable using a
 table-oriented view engine with JavaScript acting as the default view
 definition language.
 .
 CouchDB is written in Erlang, but can be easily accessed from any environment
 that provides means to make HTTP requests. There are a multitude of third-party
 client libraries that make this even easier for a variety of programming
 languages and environments.
